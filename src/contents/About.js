            Reading about new technologies, 
            solving once impossible problems, 
            providing value to a company, 
            these are the things that fuel my desire for personal growth.

            To me, this career is about more than building websites. 
            Rather, I see this career as one 
            that provides a medium between business and the humanities. 
            Having studied Anthropology at University, 
            I must say, I find myself especially fond of the following quote:
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            “… technology alone is not enough… 
            it’s technology married with liberal arts, 
            married with the humanities, 
            that yields us the results that make our heart sing.”
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Steve Jobs was right. 
            Technology will continue to make unknown things possible, 
            it will continue to make our hearts sing. 
            My hope is that my own heart can play a small role 
            in making that technology both easy to use and beautiful.
